// Why this file exists, and why every other test in this repo is blind to it.
//
// The runner stage of the Dockerfile ships `dist` and nothing else — no
// node_modules, no package.json, no bun.lock. Any bare specifier still present
// in dist/server/index.js is therefore NOT resolved from the locked dependency
// tree at run time. Bun's auto-install resolves it by DOWNLOADING THE PACKAGE
// FROM THE PUBLIC NPM REGISTRY AT THE `latest` TAG, on every container start.
//
// That is how @hasna/todos 0.13.9 died in production on 2026-08-01: the server
// bundle statically imported "@hasna/contracts/mode", the container fetched
// @hasna/contracts@0.8.7 (npm `latest`, published that morning) instead of the
// locked 0.5.2, and 0.8.7 had dropped the ./mode export. The identical bundle
// had booted fine the day before against an earlier `latest`.
//
// Every existing test passes in a tree where node_modules is present, so the
// specifier always resolves and the defect is invisible. The only test that can
// see it is one that reconstructs the runner's filesystem — a directory with
// the bundle and NO node_modules above it — with auto-install disabled and an
// empty package cache, so a network fetch cannot paper over a missing module.
//
// Both halves below carry their own positive control: a deliberately
// externalized build of the same entrypoint that MUST be rejected by the same
// harness. Without that control this test would keep passing if the harness
// itself broke, which is the exact failure mode it was written to catch.
