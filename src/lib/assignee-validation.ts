/**
 * Validation for `--assign <agent>` — the assignment path, not a sweep.
 *
 * `--assign` used to be passed straight through to the store. It accepted a
 * name that belonged to nobody, a name that belonged to several agents at
 * once, and a ROSTER SEAT, all at rc=0 and all indistinguishable afterwards
 * from a properly owned row. Owner directive k_ms8qy755_ryetl9 settles the
 * last of those: a task assigned to a seat is assigned to NOBODY. The store
 * disagrees — a seat slug is a registered agent, `todos heartbeat
 * agent-chief-staff` returns rc=0 — so the CLI has to carry the distinction
 * that the schema cannot.
 *
 * Measured on station01, 2026-08-01, over the 2566 pending tasks in the shared
 * store. Of the 493 carrying an assignee: 365 (74%) named a seat, 44 (9%)
 * named something that is not an agent at all (bare task ids, the repo name
 * `iapp-factory`, the literal string `unassigned`), and 66 (13%) named an
 * agent whose name maps to more than one row. 18 rows (3.6%) were clean.
 *
 * Why validation lives HERE and not in a cleanup sweep: a rule enforced by
 * sweep decays. The ghost-assignment defect that preceded this one minted rows
 * faster than any cleanup, and the backfill only became worth running once the
 * creation path was fixed in 0.13.7.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO — recorded so it is not "fixed" later by
 * someone reading the original bug report. The obvious design is to refuse a
 * name that is currently active under a DIFFERENT session. That check cannot
 * be written against this store: `agents.session_id` is populated on 0 of 1219
 * rows and `status` reads `active` on 1219 of 1219, so a session- or
 * status-based guard would pass unconditionally — a check that cannot fail.
 * The implementable generalisation of "someone else's live agent" is name
 * AMBIGUITY, which is real (132 names occupy more than one row) and is what
 * the `ambiguous` verdict covers.
 *
 * This module imports nothing but `node:fs`/`node:path` and the shared name
 * normaliser, for the same reason `agent-name-normalize.ts` imports nothing:
 * it is reachable from the CLI, the MCP server and both storage engines, and
 * must not drag a module graph behind it.

 * Three outcomes, and the split between REFUSE and WARN is evidence-driven

 *   `--assign agent-ceo` that means "a session will pick this up".
 * - `ambiguous` REFUSES. The name certainly exists; what cannot be done is
 *   PICK, and picking the first row is precisely how a task lands on a
 *   stranger. A fresh store cannot trip this, because a name has to occupy two
 *   rows to be ambiguous.
 * - `unknown` only WARNS. Assigning to an agent that has not registered yet is
 *   a REAL, EXISTING, TESTED contract in this CLI — `todos add --assign
 *   brutus` against a store where brutus has never registered must succeed
 *   (src/cli/creator-attribution.test.ts). Refusing it broke 9 existing tests
 *   when this validator was first written to refuse, which is exactly the
 *   legitimate flow that measurement was supposed to find. The check cannot
 *   tell a typo from a not-yet-registered agent, so it says so and gets out of
