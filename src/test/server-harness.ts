/**
 * Deterministic harness for tests that need a real todos server subprocess.
 *
 * Replaces the copy-pasted block that every server test used to carry:
 *
 *   port = 19600 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);   // guess a port
 *   proc = Bun.spawn([... `--port=${port}`]);          // hope it is free
 *   for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) { fetch(...); sleep(200); }  // poll for 10s
 *
 * Three separate failure modes lived in those three lines:
 *
 *  1. A port picked out of a hardcoded 100-wide range collides — with a parallel
 *     run of the same file, with a sibling test file that happens to share the
 *     base (ratelimit and auth-fail-closed both used 19700), or with anything
 *     else on the box. Reserving the port first (bind, stop, hand the number to a
 *     child) only narrows the race, it does not close it: the port is unowned
 *     between the stop and the child's bind. Here the CHILD asks the kernel for
 *     an ephemeral port (`--port=0`) and reports what it got, so the port is
 *     never unowned and never guessed.
 *  2. Polling for readiness encodes a guess about how slow a cold `bun run` is.
 *     The server already announces itself on stdout once the socket is accepting
 *     ("Todos Dashboard running at http://localhost:<port>"), which is both the
 *     port discovery channel and an exact readiness edge — so there is nothing
 *     to poll and no sleep to tune.
 *  3. A server that dies during startup (bad env, migration failure, auth posture
 *     refusal) used to burn the whole budget and then fail with "did not start on
 *     port N" while the actual reason sat unread in the child's stderr. Startup
 *     races the child's exit, so a crash fails immediately WITH its stderr.

 * full TS transpile of the server import graph plus schema migration on a fresh
