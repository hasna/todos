/**
 * `todos delegate <task> <worker> --brief <path>` — one atomic verb for
 * handing a filed task to a worker.
 *
 * THE MEASURED CAUSE, because it decides the shape of everything below. At 24.8
 * actionable signals an hour — one every 2.4 minutes — the ATOMIC act survives
 * and the PIPELINE dies. Filing a task is one step and ran 13 times out of 14.
 * Dispatching one was six steps across three CLIs and ran 0 times out of 14. On
 * the same day, the single instructions config that landed unaided was the
 * one-step timezone note, while all six directive pipelines died. A prompt
 * cannot close that gap, because a prompt cannot make an announcement true;
 * only a verb that writes the record AS PART OF the act can.
 *
 * So the seven effects below are ONE invocation, and the verb is worth building
 * only while it stays one. Any change that adds a required second call — a
 * follow-up `start`, a manual post, a separate registration — reproduces the
 * failure this was built to remove, and will fail the same way, silently, while
 * looking implemented.
 *
 * THE SEVEN EFFECTS, in order:
 *   1. REFUSE an absent or empty brief. Runs first, before any write, so a bad
 *      invocation costs nothing. See `lib/delegation-brief.ts`.
 *   2. READ AND PRINT the receiving seat's open count; park only when a
 *      threshold is armed. See `lib/delegation-policy.ts` for why the default
 *      is unset.
 *   3. REGISTER the worker identity, lineage-linked to the dispatcher.
 *   4. ASSIGN the row and populate assigned_by / delegated_from /
 *      delegation_depth.
 *   5. APPEND the [DISPATCH] comment — this is what makes the act and the
 *      record one event rather than two things someone has to remember.
 *   6. POST the one-line channel notice, once.
 *   7. RECORD a claim deadline for the steering pass.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO, and this is load-bearing rather than an
 * omission: it never writes `started_at`. The worker still claims with `todos
 * start`. That keeps `started_at` honest AND keeps this verb's own failure mode
 * countable — a dispatched row nobody claimed stays visibly unclaimed, so
 * "dispatch laundering" (a [DISPATCH] comment older than the claim window on a
 * row with a null started_at) is a query rather than a guess. A verb that
 * stamped started_at would launder its own failures into apparent progress.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT `dispatch`. That verb is taken, and it is the route operating
 * rule 12 forbids: it types a prompt into a tmux pane and presses Enter. It is
 * left entirely alone here, along with its `dispatch run` subcommand, its
 * sibling `dispatches`, and their two SQLite tables. `delegate` also fits the
 * data model rather than fighting it — `delegated_from` and `delegation_depth`
 * were already columns, so the noun existed and only the verb was missing.

 * outage must not become a delegation outage, and it must not roll back a row
 * that has already been handed over.
 *
 * It is also never retried inside the verb. A duplicated notice trains readers
 * to ignore the channel, which is the failure the whole verb is fighting. The
 * recovery path is a re-run with --no-post.
 *
 * The binary is resolved from configuration so the cross-CLI hop is testable in
 * BOTH directions without touching the real service — a suppression-only test
 * would pass even if the notice never worked at all.
