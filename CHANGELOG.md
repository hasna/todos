# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.11] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- **Hosted guarded plan/project linkage now fails closed on invalid success
  payloads.** The cloud client validates complete nested plan, project, task,
  count, revision, receipt, digest, and rollback invariants before accepting an
  HTTP 2xx response, and normalizes idempotency keys before both the remote write
  and receipt validation so a successful mutation cannot be reported as a
  client-side failure ([#220](https://github.com/hasna/todos/pull/220)).

## [0.15.10] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Existing plans can now be linked atomically to one authoritative project.**
  Linkage validates exact plan, project, and member-task revisions; records
  immutable apply and rollback receipts with every prior task link; and enforces
  the chosen project for future plan members across SQLite, PostgreSQL, the v1
  API, SDK, and CLI ([#215](https://github.com/hasna/todos/pull/215)).

## [0.15.9] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- **SQLite project registration no longer rolls back unrelated successful task
  writes.** The 0.15.7 authority path awaited project/list discovery and digest
  work while a transaction remained open on the shared SQLite connection, so a
  later authority failure could roll back an ordinary supported task write that
  had already returned success. Registration now stages all asynchronous work
  outside the transaction, revalidates the exact read set, and applies the staged
  mutations atomically under `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; forward and inverse fault
  regressions prove unrelated writes survive while concurrent authority calls
  serialize or retry safely ([#208](https://github.com/hasna/todos/pull/208)).
- **Ambiguous `todos list --assigned <name>` reads now disclose that the returned
  queue is partial.** Literal-only fallback remains non-fatal and preserves JSON
  stdout, but stderr now names the ambiguity instead of making a populated partial
  result indistinguishable from a complete queue
  ([#206](https://github.com/hasna/todos/pull/206)).

Containment: `0.15.7` remains deprecated and was removed from `latest`; the
registry intentionally stays on known-good `0.15.6` until this fix is released.
Version `0.15.8` was already reserved by a separate release lane and is skipped,
so `0.15.9` is the first releasable package containing the SQLite repair.

## [0.15.7] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- **Protected conditional project and task-list registration.** The package-owned
  `@hasna/todos/project-registration` SDK and authenticated `/v1/project-registration`
  routes create or bind an exact project/list pair under immutable request digests,
  deterministic retries, exact receipt readback, and bounded ambiguity reconciliation
  across SQLite and hosted PostgreSQL.

### Fixed

- **Registration compensation now refuses unsafe rollback.** Receipt-scoped
  compensation verifies ownership, parent state, and dependent records before removing
  an accepted registration, and refuses without mutation when foreign or user-created
  data would otherwise be detached or deleted.

## [0.15.6] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- **`show` and `inspect` advertised a comment cursor that no verb could spend, so every
  comment older than the newest page was unreachable from the CLI.** Both commands emit
  `comments_page` with `has_more: true`, a `next_cursor`, and `pagination_supported: true`,
  and both called `cloudListComments(cloud, id)` with no options — while that reader has
  accepted `{ limit, cursor }` all along and is unit-tested for it. `show --help` listed
  no options beyond `-h`, `--cursor`/`--comments-cursor` were rejected as unknown, and no
  `comments` verb exists (`comment` is write-only), so the advertised cursor had no
  consumer anywhere in the CLI. Measured on a live 125-comment task: the newest 100 were
  returned and the remaining 25 could not be read by any command. `show` and `inspect` now
  take `--comments-limit <n>` (1-500) and `--comments-cursor <cursor>`, so the cursor a
  page hands you is spendable by the command that produced it; walking that live task now
  yields 100 + 25 = 125 distinct comments with zero overlap and terminates at
  `has_more: false`. The local (SQLite) read path accepts the same flags with the same
  semantics through a shared pager; without a flag its output is unchanged — the complete
  history and no `comments_page` — so existing local consumers are unaffected.

  Note on the ordering, because the reported symptom pointed the other way: a page is the
  **newest** `limit` comments in **ascending** display order, so the newest comment is the
  **last** array element and was always reachable. `next_cursor` walks toward **older**
  history, which is the direction that was blocked. A `--comments-limit 1` read returns the
  single newest comment, which is the probe that distinguishes the two readings.

- **The comment cursor codec was private to the `/v1` server**, so the CLI could not decode
  a cursor the server had minted. `encodeCommentCursor`/`decodeCommentCursor` moved to
  `src/lib/comment-cursor.ts` alongside the pure pager both read paths now share; the
  server imports them and its behaviour is unchanged. A second copy of keyset logic is how
  the two ends drift into disagreeing about what a cursor means.

## [0.15.5] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- **`todos delegate` — one atomic verb for handing a task to a worker.** A delegation
  previously took four to six separate commands (`update --assign`, a comment carrying
  the brief, an `agents register` for the worker, a channel post), each of which could
  half-happen. Nothing tied them together, so a row could end up assigned with no brief,
  briefed with no assignee, or dispatched with no record anyone could grep. `delegate`
  performs the ordered effects in one call and refuses before the first write when the
  handover would be incomplete.
  - **A brief is mandatory and is gated on both sides.** `--brief <path>`,
    `--brief-text <text>`, or `--brief -` for stdin. A missing, unreadable, zero-byte or
    whitespace-only brief is refused with the offending path named and the row left
    byte-identical; the accepted content is stored untrimmed with its sha256, so a brief
    cannot be silently substituted later.
  - **Handover lineage is persisted on the row** — `assigned_by`, `delegated_from` and
    `delegation_depth`, written in a single patch. The write branches test
    `!== undefined` rather than truthiness, so `delegation_depth: 0` and an explicit
    `delegated_from: null` are honoured instead of being dropped. Depth increments from
    the parent row, so a re-delegated task records its chain.
  - **The row is left claimable.** `started_at` and `locked_by` stay `NULL` and status
    stays `pending`: delegation assigns and briefs, it does not claim. The worker's own
    `todos start` is still what takes the lock, which keeps the dispatched-but-unclaimed
    population countable.
  - **A greppable `[DISPATCH]` comment** carrying worker, dispatcher, brief source and
    digest, lineage, and the claim deadline — the marker is the first thing on the first
    line so counters can anchor on it. The deadline also lands in task metadata as a
    queryable field, merged read-modify-write so a concurrent writer's keys survive.
  - **Read-back verification.** After the patch the row is re-read and every field the
    delegation claims to have written is checked. If the authority accepted the request
    but did not persist the lineage, the command refuses and names the missing fields
    *before* the `[DISPATCH]` comment is written, so a partial delegation can never be
    reported as a complete one. This matters most where `assigned_by` still holds the
    filer — a plausible value, which is what would otherwise make the no-op invisible.
  - **Depth threshold and embargo are data, not constants.** The threshold ships unset:
    the seat-queue count and any recorded override are unconditional, while parking is
    opt-in via flag, environment or config. The embargo is an owner-editable file that
    self-disables when absent, and it is enforced against both the worker's name and its
    agent id, since resolving an id to a name would otherwise bypass a name-only check.
  - Registered in both the canonical command list and the remote command list.
    Canonical-only would have left the verb local-only, which the `/v1` route refuses —
    a state that is invisible from `--help`.
  - `dispatch` and `dispatches` are unchanged and still registered. No schema change, no
    migration, and no change to any server route.

## [0.15.4] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **`todos comment` ignored the per-session identity environment variable, so every
  unflagged comment was silently unattributable.** `todos comment <id> <text>` (alias
  `log-progress`) read `agent_id: globalOpts.agent` directly at both the cloud and the
  local `addComment` call site — a bare read of the `--agent` flag that never called
  `resolveWritableIdentity`. `add`, `start`, and `done` all already resolved through that
  helper, which checks the explicit flag first and then the two supported per-session
  variables `TODOS_AGENT_ID` and `HASNA_TODOS_AGENT_ID` (never the station-shared
  `identity.json`, which is not process-bound). Because `comment` never called it, that
  documented escape hatch was invisible on this one command: a comment written with the
  variable exported and no flag landed with `agent_id` null on the local store and
  attributed to the shared `fleet` principal on the cloud path — rc=0, printing
  `Comment added.`, with no warning that the attribution had been dropped. Both call
  sites now resolve through `resolveWritableIdentity(globalOpts.agent)`, matching the
  pattern `add` already uses: an explicit `--agent` still wins and keeps its original
  casing, and the resolver's canonicalised value is used only when no flag was passed.
  Regression coverage in `creator-attribution.test.ts` mirrors the existing `add` cases —
  attributes from the environment variable (this case fails without the fix), `--agent`
  still wins over the variable, stays null with neither, and never attributes from the
  persisted identity file (todos task `39b4255b`, PR #196).

## [0.15.3] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **`todos add --assign <agent>` silenced the attribution warning while `created_by`
  went null.** After 0.15.2 routed `created_by` through the guarded
  `resolveWritableIdentity`, the ownerless-warning gate in `todos add` still keyed
  only on `assignee` — a check that used to imply attribution but no longer does. An
  anonymous filer that passed `--assign <agent>` got a real owner and a silently null
  `created_by`, because giving the row an assignee suppressed the one warning that
  would have said so. The warning now fires independently on whichever condition is
  true — no assignee, or no writable identity — so an assigned-but-unattributed row
  now says so on stderr instead of filing in silence (todos task `a3f4bb1a`).
- **`todos init`'s success message still promised automatic attribution that 0.15.2
  removed.** The line printed on every successful `init` — "Identity saved — later
  commands attribute to this agent automatically" — became false on every column
  (`created_by`, `agent_id`, `assigned_to`) once the persisted identity file was
  narrowed to a display-only diagnostic. The collision path already named the correct
  escape hatch (`export TODOS_AGENT_ID=<name>`); the success path — the one every
  fresh session hits — now prints the same instruction instead of the opposite one
  (todos task `a3f4bb1a`).

## [0.15.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- **`created_by` no longer inherits the station-shared identity `todos init` persists.**
  `todos add` and the MCP `create_task` tool resolved `created_by` through
  `resolveCreatorIdentity`, which falls back to `~/.hasna/todos/identity.json` — a file
  keyed on `$HOME` and shared by every agent session on a station, so it names the box
  rather than the caller. `agent_id`/`assigned_to` were already narrowed to the guarded
  `resolveWritableIdentity` in `0.14.x` (#142); `created_by` was deliberately left on the
  wider resolver on the premise that the change was inert on the hosted path because the
  deployed server dropped the column outright. That premise no longer holds — the server
  now persists and serves `created_by` — and the residual produced 489 real rows on one
  station misattributed to whichever agent last ran `todos init` there (todos task
  `9090972e`). `created_by` now resolves the same way as `agent_id`: unattributable
  (`null`) unless a process-bound identity (`--agent`, `--created-by`, `TODOS_AGENT_ID`,
  or `HASNA_TODOS_AGENT_ID`) is given.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **Cloud `link-ref` / `find-ref` round-trips now support refs containing `/` and
  `#`.** The v1 server decodes the opaque ref segment after route matching and returns
  a stable 400 for malformed percent encoding.
- **The npm release workflow no longer dirties its checkout during the full suite.**
  The model-config test restores the runner's original `HOME` instead of deleting it,
  preventing later config writes from creating a literal `~/.hasna/todos/config.json`
  inside the repository. A pre-publish cleanliness assertion now reports the path and
  stops before npm lifecycle hooks if this regresses.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-03

Numbered as a minor for the same reason `0.13.13` was renumbered to `0.14.0` the day
before: this release rejects CLI input that `0.14.0` accepted, and under 0.x semver the
minor is the field that signals that. A patch would have let a `^0.14` range absorb it
silently, which is the outcome the previous renumber existed to prevent.

The scope is narrower than `0.14.0`'s. That release rejected out-of-vocabulary enums on
`todos list` and on three HTTP endpoints, and it named those surfaces explicitly. It did
not cover `todos watch`, and it did not treat an empty or blank enum element as invalid.
Both gaps are closed here, so input that survived `0.14.0` can now fail.

### Added

- **`todos bulk tag|untag <ids...> --tag <comma-separated>`.** Adds or removes tags
  across many tasks in one invocation, on both the `/v1` and local SQLite paths.
  Previously `bulk` could reassign a plan across many tasks but could not tag them,
  and `todos tag` / `todos untag` take one id and one tag — so stamping a tag across a
  backlog cost one process per task.

  Semantics chosen so a large backfill is safe to run and safe to re-run:

  - **Merges, never replaces.** `todos update --tags` replaces the tag list; reusing
    that here would strip every unrelated tag from every row the run touched.
  - **Idempotent.** A row that already satisfies the request is skipped with no write,
    so a re-run after a partial failure does not bump row versions or emit audit noise.
  - **Fails closed** when `--tag` is absent, and when `--tag` and `--tags` are both
    given but name different sets — a silently dropped tag argument would report
    success while applying the wrong tags.
  - Tags split on commas only; `:` and `/` are preserved, which namespaced tags such as
    `repo:secrets` and `gh:hasna/todos` depend on.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (CLI): `todos watch --status` now validates its value against the status
  vocabulary.** `watch` shared `list`'s closed vocabulary and failed the way `list` used
  to: an out-of-vocabulary status matched no rows, so `todos watch --status open` painted
  a permanently empty dashboard that reads as "there is no work". This is worse than the
  `list` case it mirrors, because a live view invites an operator to sit and watch it.
  `watch` now exits non-zero and names the accepted vocabulary. Documented aliases
  (`done` -> `completed`) still resolve, so every previously *valid* input behaves
  identically; only previously *invalid* input changes, from a silent empty view at exit
  0 to a named rejection.
- **BREAKING (CLI): an empty or blank enum element is now rejected instead of being
  dropped.** `--status=` was parsed by Commander as an explicit empty string and fell
  back to the default filter at exit 0, and a blank list member meant `--status pending,`
  and `--priority high,,critical` were accepted as though a clean list had been typed.
  Both are almost always a stray comma or a shell expanding `--status "$A,$B"` with one
  variable unset, and in both cases the filter did not deliver what was asked for.
  Surrounding whitespace on a non-empty element (` pending , high`) stays tolerated,
  because that is a shape operators legitimately type.

### Fixed

- **`todos list` now applies its window after sorting rather than before**, so a bounded
  list returns the first N of the sorted result instead of an arbitrary N that was then
  sorted among itself. The remote scan is bounded by an explicit ceiling sent to the
  cloud API; the ceiling applies to the remote path by construction and never to local
  SQLite.
- **`todos list` no longer warns about an assignee it never queried.** The empty-result
  warning resolved the assignee separately from the query, so `--assigned <bogus>
  --inbox` warned about a value that was never used as a filter, while
  `--agent-name "" --assigned <bogus>` stayed silent about the value that actually was.
  The effective assignee is now resolved once and read for both the filter and the
  warning.
- **`todos add` warns instead of silently filing a task with no project.** The local
  branch fell back to project auto-detection when `--project` was absent; the cloud
  branch did not, and the fleet runs cloud, so every fleet create stored a NULL project
  silently. Such a row appears in no per-seat list and no drain reaches it. Measured
  against the hosted store on 2026-08-03: 578 of 3231 pending rows (17.9%) carried a NULL
  project, and 93 of the 283 rows created in the preceding 24 hours (32.9%) did. It warns
  rather than rejects, deliberately — a third of live creations omit the project, so
  rejecting would take the CLI offline for that traffic. `--no-project` silences the
  warning, mirroring the `--unassigned` flag this command already ships for the same
  shape of problem on the assignee field. The cloud create also sends `working_dir`
  again, which the local branch had always sent.
- **`todos workflows`, `template-library`, `onboarding` and `sdk-fixtures` now serve
  their bundled static content on the `/v1` route** instead of exiting 1 with
  `REMOTE_COMMAND_UNSUPPORTED`, which is what `manual` — also bundled static — already
  did. The shipped manual documents `todos workflows` in its own examples. The four are
  admitted per invocation rather than wholesale: `onboarding --import` and
  `sdk-fixtures --show/--write` reach a store-backed import path, so those invocations
  are still refused rather than opening a route to SQLite where the local fallback is
  deliberately disabled.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-02

This release was prepared as `0.13.13` and renumbered before publishing. It carries a
breaking CLI change, and under 0.x semver the minor is the field that signals one — a
patch number would have let a `^0.13` range pick it up silently. No `0.13.13` was ever
published to npm; `0.13.12` is the version this supersedes.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (CLI and HTTP API): an out-of-vocabulary enum value is now rejected
  instead of returning an empty result.** Passing an unsupported value — the common
  case is a `--status` word that is not one of `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`,
  `failed`, `cancelled` — previously produced a clean empty list that was
  indistinguishable from "no tasks matched", so a typo read as a true negative. The
  CLI now exits non-zero and names the accepted vocabulary, and three HTTP endpoints
  now answer **400** where they previously answered 200 with an empty list:
  `GET /v1/tasks` validates `status` and `priority`, and `GET /api/tasks` and
  `GET /api/tasks/export` validate `status`. `?status=open` is the canonical
  example. Any script or API client that depended on the silent-empty behaviour
  will start failing loudly; that is the intent.

### Fixed

- **Reaching any terminal status through the generic update path now releases the
  task lock.** Only `completed` did before, so `--status failed` and
  `--status cancelled` left `locked_by` and `locked_at` set permanently — a terminal
  task cannot be started again, so nothing could ever re-acquire the lock and clear
  it, and lazy repair-on-reacquisition could never reach the row. Both storage
  adapters are corrected; on the hosted adapter the hole was wider than first
  reported, having never released a lock for any terminal status including
  `completed`.
- The CLI now surfaces the server's own reason on a remote 400/4xx failure instead
  of swallowing it, so a rejected request explains itself rather than presenting as
  a generic failure.
- Registering an agent through the hosted path no longer mints a case variant of an
  existing name. This closes the remaining write path that could recreate the
  split-identity condition 0.13.12 fixed on the read side.
- **The MCP `rename_agent` and `rebalance_workload` tools now leave an ambiguous
  case-variant assignee alone instead of resolving it arbitrarily.** Where a database
  holds two distinct agents whose names differ only by case — the same split-identity
  condition the entry above closes at its source — `rename_agent` matched `assigned_to`
  case-insensitively and therefore moved *both* agents' tasks onto the renamed one, and
  `rebalance_workload` indexed both roster rows under one lower-cased key, attributing
  those tasks to whichever row happened to be indexed last. `rename_agent` now widens to
  a case-insensitive match only when the old name uniquely identifies the agent being
  renamed, and uses an exact match when it does not; `rebalance_workload` marks a
  colliding alias ambiguous and skips those assignments rather than guessing. The
  observable difference on a database carrying such a collision is that `rename_agent`
  reports fewer updated tasks and `rebalance_workload` reports fewer moves — that is the
  wrong work no longer being done. This is not marked breaking because what it replaces
  was not a contract: in the colliding case the outcome was arbitrary — whichever roster
  row was indexed last — and no caller can have depended on it. It does carry one
  regression, named here rather than left to be found: `rename_agent`'s uniqueness guard
  resolves the old name through `resolvePartialId`, which treats any string of 36
  characters or more as a full UUID and looks it up on the `id` column, so it reports
  "not unique" for every agent name that long even when no collision exists. Such an
  agent's differently-cased task rows are now left on the stale name after a rename.
  Tracked as a follow-up.
- Multi-value task filters are now modelled correctly in the generated API schema
  (`style: form`, `explode: false`), so generated clients emit the **comma-separated
  single parameter** the server actually reads — `?status=pending,in_progress`. The
  server reads each filter with `searchParams.get()` and splits on `,`; it never calls
  `getAll`, so a client emitting a repeated parameter has only its first value honoured.

### Note

- **This release does not retro-clear task locks that already leaked.** That sweep is
  deliberately excluded rather than overlooked: clearing a lock bumps the row version
  and rewrites `updated_at`, and the change feeds page on `updated_at`, so sweeping
  the existing terminal rows would push every one of them through those feeds to
  repair something the reporting layer already handles. This release stops new leaks;
  the accumulated rows remain a separate, explicit decision.

## [0.13.12] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Alias-resolve `assigned_to` on every remaining sibling exact-match call site
  (~20 sites behind one shared resolver), including a rebalance-load path where
  an overloaded agent's queue was silently undercounted. `assigned_to` has held
  an agent ID from one write path and a resolved name from another, plus case
  variants, so exact-match reads returned a silent subset. `#160` fixed the
  list filter; this closes the remaining call sites.
- **This is a local `bun:sqlite` fix.** Agents on the hosted API (`/v1`) are
  unaffected: the hosted service lacks Postgres equivalents for most of these
  code paths and runs an older client version regardless. This release changes
  nothing for hosted-mode agents.

## [0.13.11] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- `todos update --assign <seat>` now points callers at a `--assign-seat` invocation
  that actually runs. The prior refusal message named the flag in a shape the verb
  rejects, so an agent following it hit a second error and could conclude the CLI
  was recommending a broken flag. The corrected hint is client-side, so it reaches
  every installed agent immediately rather than waiting on the hosted service.

## [0.13.10] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Starting a failed task through the versioned remote API now returns a deterministic
  `409 TASK_NOT_STARTABLE` response that explains the required reset to `pending`, and
  the CLI preserves that domain error instead of reporting the Todos authority as
  unavailable. Pending tasks continue to start normally on both SQLite and PostgreSQL.

## [0.13.3] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- **`@hasna/todos/testing` — a shipped test-isolation helper, so a consumer's test suite
  cannot write into the shared hosted store.** Measured on 2026-07-30, three repositories
  had between them left **2,094 rows** in the live authority purely from tests:
  1,151 from `hasnaxyz/iapp-takumi` (`Short ID resolution test`, `Scoped getTask resolution
  test`, `seed-task-<epoch>` under `test-resolution-*` projects) and 943 `Merge the release
  PR` rows from `hasna/loops`' `drain.test.ts`, which shelled out to the real `todos` CLI
  with an unmodified `process.env`. None was ever assigned, commented on, or actioned.
  The cause is the same in every case: the client resolves its transport from the
  environment, and every shell on a fleet machine exports the shared-store pointers.

  The export is `SHARED_TODOS_STORE_ENV_KEYS` (the routing variables, held as **one
  constant shared with the resolver that reads them** — including the legacy unprefixed
  API URL and key aliases a hand-rolled consumer copy reliably misses),
  plus `localTodosTestEnv()`, `applyLocalTodosTestEnv()` (with exact restore) and
  `assertLocalTodosTestEnv()`. It is published as a subpath so the list lives next to the
  resolver: a consumer-side reimplementation stops protecting anything the day this package
  adds a routing variable, and that failure mode is a green suite silently writing to
  production.

  Guarded by two tests that fail rather than drift: one regex-scans the resolver for every
  `TODOS_*` variable it reads and fails if any is neither scrubbed nor explicitly declared
  local-only; the other fails if the subpath ships without its declaration file.

### Fixed

- **`todos doctor` no longer reports healthy on a dataset full of orphaned rows.** In remote
  mode it returned a HARDCODED `ok: true` after checking only authentication and route
  availability, printed three green check marks and exited `0` — on the live authority that
  meant 10,176 orphaned tasks (4,735 of them still open) and 45 unbound task lists passed as
  healthy, which is why nothing else in that dataset was caught either. It already fetched
  every task list and every project and reduced them to `.length`, so the rows it needed were
  in hand and discarded. Neither mode ever counted a null or dangling `project_id` /
  `task_list_id`, and the local path never set a non-zero exit code even for an
  error-severity check.
- **The verdict is now derived from the counts that are printed.** Doctor counts six
  referential conditions (`tasks_without_project`, `tasks_without_task_list`,
  `tasks_with_unregistered_project`, `tasks_with_unregistered_task_list`,
  `task_lists_without_project`, `task_lists_with_unregistered_project`), one aggregate query
  each, and `ok` / the exit code are a pure function of those rows. A dangling reference is
  always an error; a null one escalates from warning to error once it hides OPEN work.
- **A condition that cannot be measured is never folded into "all clear".** It is reported as
  `NOT CHECKED` with the reason, and the report is INCOMPLETE.

### Added

- **Direct unit coverage for previously untested local task-runner and agent-task sync modules.**
  The tests exercise successful execution and synchronization as well as missing tasks,
  failed handlers, aborted runs, empty queues, malformed files, and unavailable paths.
- **`GET /v1/integrity`** — per-condition referential-integrity counts computed by the backing
  storage engine, for **both** SQLite and the Postgres JSONB record store (which has no
  foreign keys and is therefore where these rows actually accumulate). A backend that cannot
  answer returns `501` rather than a false clean. `TodosStorageAdapter.integrity` is
  implemented by both adapters.
- **`todos doctor --scan-tasks`** — remote-only, read-only paged walk of `/v1/tasks` that
  derives the task-level conditions when the authority predates the aggregate route
  (`/v1/tasks` filters cannot express `IS NULL`). A walk that cannot complete marks the
  conditions unverified instead of reporting a partial count as truth.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (exit code): `todos doctor` exit codes are now a verdict.** `0` clean · `1`
  findings (any orphan/dangling reference, or an error-severity check) · `2` incomplete (no
  findings, but a condition could not be measured). Advisory warnings (stale `in_progress`
  tasks, project paths missing on this machine, duplicate indexes) do not change the exit
  code. `--no-fail-on-findings` is the explicit opt-out for a consumer that gates on exit `0`;
  findings are still reported, and the printed exit code is always the one the process
  returns — a suppressed run prints `(exit 0 — findings gate suppressed by
  --no-fail-on-findings; the verdict is 1)` rather than a `(exit 1)` the process never
  used. `doctor --json` gains an `integrity` block (`schema_version:
  "todos.integrity.v1"`) plus `exit_code` (the status the process RETURNS),
  `verdict_exit_code` (the status the rows IMPLY) and `fail_on_findings`; `ok` keeps its
  name and finally means what it says.
- **Integrity findings are report-only.** `doctor --apply` repairs schema/hygiene only and
  never rewrites, deletes or re-points an orphaned row; `--apply` remains refused outright
  against a remote authority.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **`blocked_by` now means "tasks that block me" on every machine-readable surface —
  the inverted orientation deadlocked dependency chains** (task 4599ef37). `todos deps
  <id> --json` (schema `todos.task_dependency_edges.v1`), `todos show/inspect --json`,
  `getTaskWithRelations`, and the self-hosted hydration all placed this task's
  DEPENDENTS in the field named `blocked_by`, while the human `Depends on:`/`Blocks:`
  output read the same data correctly. Schedulers consuming the JSON by name
  (@hasnaxyz/factory) therefore refused to dispatch the UPSTREAM task of every
  dependency chain with `dependency_unmet` — the chain deadlocked its own blocker.
  Now: `dependencies` = all prerequisites (upstream), `blocked_by` = the incomplete
  prerequisites currently blocking the task (empty ⇒ dispatchable; completed and
  cancelled prerequisites do not block, matching `getBlockedTasks`), and the
  dependents moved to a new `blocks` field (matching the human `Blocks:` label). The
  schema version stays `v1`: consumers pin it fail-closed, and the payload now finally
  matches what v1's field names always claimed. The `/v1/tasks/:id/dependencies` wire
  payload additionally carries the incoming edges under a new `blocks` key while
  keeping the deprecated `blocked_by` alias (same contents) so pre-0.13.2 fleet
  clients keep rendering `Blocks:` correctly; the CLI prefers `blocks` and falls back
  to the legacy name against older servers.

- **Secret redaction no longer destroys the clean value under a redacted key.** Once a
  secret-shaped object key was reduced to a pattern-specific placeholder
  (`[REDACTED_GITHUB_TOKEN]`, `[REDACTED_NPM_TOKEN]`), key-based redaction matched the word
  `TOKEN` inside the placeholder itself and replaced the untouched value beneath it with
  `[REDACTED]` — silent loss of non-secret data. Redaction is now idempotent for keys that are
  *entirely* a placeholder. Keys of the form `NAME=[REDACTED]` are deliberately **not** exempt:
  that shape is what env-assignment redaction produces, and the value beneath it is opaque, so
  key-based redaction must still apply there. **Accepted trade-off:** a key named *literally*
  `[REDACTED_GITHUB_TOKEN]` / `[REDACTED_TOKEN]` / `[REDACTED_PASSWORD]` no longer has its value
  redacted by key name — previously it did, because the placeholder text contains `TOKEN` /
  `PASSWORD`. Such a key is indistinguishable from this module's own output, and keeping it
  exempt is what makes redaction idempotent.

### Known issues

- **Secret-bearing metadata *keys* are not redacted on every write path.** `redactValue()`
  redacts metadata values but leaves key text intact; only `sanitizePreWriteValue()` rewrites
  keys. Task metadata is covered (via `sanitizeUpdateTaskInput`), but `task_findings.metadata`
  is built with `redactValue()` alone and persists a credential placed in key position — and
  `metadata_keys` is emitted in compact finding output, whose contract states that "metadata
  values are intentionally omitted", treating keys as the safe half. Pre-existing, not
  introduced here; tracked separately.

### Documentation

- **Documents pre-write secret sanitation, which has been active and undocumented since
  0.12.0.** Credential-shaped text in task `title`, `description`, `tags`, `metadata`, `reason`,
  comments, verification, dispatch, inbox, run and artifact payloads is redacted **before it is
  persisted**, not at display time. Consequences worth knowing: the original text is **not
  recoverable** — `show`/`inspect` return the stored, redacted value, and there is currently no
  `--raw` / `--no-redact` escape hatch. This supersedes the earlier contract (0.11.x) in which
  only broad `list`/`search` output was redacted while explicit detail output returned the raw
  value; the `redactBroadTask`/`redactBroadTasks` display layer still exists but can no longer
  observe an unredacted stored value. Legitimate text that merely resembles a credential (for
  example a note containing `Bearer <12+ chars>`) is redacted on write and cannot be restored.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Machine-readable dependency reads.** `todos deps <id> --json` now returns a versioned,
  status-bearing edge payload (`schema_version: "todos.task_dependency_edges.v1"`) with
  `dependencies` (upstream prerequisites) and `blocked_by` (downstream dependents) as compact
  `{ id, short_id, title, status, priority, plan_id, project_id }` nodes — identical in local
  and self-hosted mode. New whole-project graph read `todos deps --project <ref> --json`
  (`schema_version: "todos.project_dependency_graph.v1"`) returns `nodes` + adjacency `edges` +
  `cycles` in a single call, so a scheduler can order a batch of tasks without one `deps <id>`
  call per task.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (CLI JSON contract): `todos deps <id> --json` output shape changed.** It previously
  emitted divergent, unversioned shapes — local returned full task rows under
  `dependencies`/`blocked_by`, while self-hosted returned bare `{ task_id, depends_on }` edges
  with no status. Both now emit the unified `todos.task_dependency_edges.v1` shape above (compact
  nodes; self-hosted gains id + status parity). Scripts that read fields only present on the full
  task row (e.g. `description`, `tags`, `created_at`, `metadata`) from `deps --json` must migrate to
  `show --json` / `inspect --json`. Human (non-JSON) output and `deps <id> --graph --json` are
  unchanged.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-25

### Security

- **`/api/*` and `/mcp` no longer fail open when no API key is configured.** `checkAuth`
  began with `if (!apiKey && !generatedKeysEnabled) return null; // no key configured,
  skip auth`, so a server started without `TODOS_API_KEY` and without a stored key
  treated **every** request as authorized. On any deployment that binds a non-loopback
  host (e.g. `HOST=0.0.0.0` behind a load balancer) that published, to anonymous
  callers: `POST /mcp` (the full MCP tool catalog plus `tools/call` — create/start/
  complete/fail task, register agent, findings, run transactions), the entire `/api/*`
  REST CRUD surface (tasks, projects, agents, plans, orgs, templates, webhooks,
  pr-groups), the information-disclosing `/api/doctor` (internal database path) and
  `/api/headless` (boundary manifest), and the unbounded SSE streams `/api/events` and
  `/api/tasks/stream`. The MCP mount was already inside the auth choke point — the
  choke point itself returned "authorized".
  The unconfigured case now **denies**. A single startup decision
  (`resolveAuthPosture`, `src/server/auth-posture.ts`) resolves one of:
  - `enforce` — a credential source exists (`TODOS_API_KEY`/`--api-key`, or ≥1 stored
    key): every `/api/*` and `/mcp` request must present it;
  - `local-plane-disabled` — a hosted deployment (cloud `DATABASE_URL` configured, so
    the self-authenticating `/v1` plane works) with no local credential: `/api/*` and
    `/mcp` are not served at all (`404 LOCAL_PLANE_DISABLED`), while `/v1` and the
    health probes keep working, so closing the hole cannot cause an outage;
  - `anonymous-loopback` — explicitly requested via `--allow-anonymous` /
    `TODOS_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=1` **and** a loopback bind host; anonymous requests are
    additionally required to come from a loopback transport peer (the check ignores
    `x-forwarded-for`, so `TODOS_TRUST_PROXY=1` cannot be used to spoof one). The
    stored-key check is re-evaluated per request under this posture, so
    `todos api-keys create` closes an already-open anonymous window without a restart;
  - otherwise the server **refuses to start**, exiting non-zero with an actionable
    error naming `TODOS_API_KEY` — starting wide open is never an option.
  `/v1` was not affected (it authenticates itself against the cloud API-key store) and
  `/health`, `/ready`, `/version`, `/openapi.json` remain public by design, so
  load-balancer and container health checks are unchanged.
  Regression coverage: `src/server/auth-fail-closed.test.ts` (unconfigured server exits
  non-zero and nothing listens; every `/api/*` read and write route, `POST`/`GET`/
  `DELETE /mcp`, and `/v1` reject a credential-less request; probes stay public) and
  `src/server/auth-posture.test.ts` (full posture matrix, including "no input ever
  yields an anonymous plane on an off-box bind").

### Changed

- **BREAKING (local):** `todos serve` / `todos-serve` with no `TODOS_API_KEY` and no
  stored API key now exits non-zero instead of serving `/api/*` anonymously. Migrate
  with `todos api-keys create "<name>"` (then send `x-api-key`), or, for loopback-only
  local development and the bundled dashboard, `todos serve --allow-anonymous`. The
  flag is refused for a non-loopback `--host`. `todos-mcp --http` is unchanged: it is
  loopback-pinned by contract, so it opts into the anonymous local plane implicitly
  (set `TODOS_API_KEY` to enforce auth there too).
- `src/test/local-routing-env.fixture.test.ts` also clears `DATABASE_URL` /
  `TODOS_DATABASE_URL` / `HASNA_TODOS_DATABASE_URL` / `TODOS_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` so a
  live DSN or opt-in in a developer's environment cannot flip a local-intent test's
  auth posture.

### Docs

- `docs/hosted-auth-runbook.md` — posture matrix, the per-caller migration table, the
  owner-gated ECS redeploy steps (including that the deployed task definition sets no
  `TODOS_API_KEY`, so no new secret is required to close the hole), and post-deploy
  verification commands.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- Remote `show`/`inspect` no longer report empty `dependencies`/`blocked_by` while `deps <id>` lists persisted edges (#58). The `/v1` task row endpoint returns no relation graphs, and the cloud detail assembly hard-coded both arrays to `[]`, so a blocked remote task looked unblocked and `inspect` never printed its `BLOCKED by N unfinished dep(s)` warning. `show`/`inspect` now read `GET /v1/tasks/:id/dependencies` and hydrate each referenced id into a full task row (deduplicated across both directions, bounded concurrency), matching local-mode output. An edge whose target task cannot be read degrades to an explicit `(unavailable task …)` placeholder instead of erasing the readable relations, and a dependency-endpoint failure warns on stderr rather than sinking the whole detail view (a `404`/`501` from a server without the route is silently treated as "no edges").

## [0.12.2] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- `todos bulk plan|move-plan --plan <id>` / `--clear-plan` now works under a remote (`self_hosted`/cloud) authority. Stage A rejected the whole invocation with `REMOTE_COMMAND_UNSUPPORTED` because the bulk handler resolved the plan reference through the local SQLite `resolvePlanId`, which is unavailable in remote mode. The cloud path now resolves the plan against the shared dataset (`cloudResolvePlan`) once, up front, so an unknown plan still fails closed before any task is mutated, and the Stage-A gate admits the two plan actions. Single-task `todos update <id> --plan` was already remote-capable; bulk reassignment is now at parity (#31).

## [0.12.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- SQLite task search no longer silently degrades or fails on queries containing punctuation. The `shouldUseFts` gate rejected any query with punctuation (e.g. `login: urgent`), falling back to a literal substring LIKE that matched nothing. A real FTS5 query parser now handles punctuation safely: AND-by-default terms, quoted phrases, and prefix matching, with FTS5 operator characters stripped/quoted instead of rejected.
- Task search is now bounded. `searchTasks` built its SQL with no `LIMIT`, so a broad query scanned/returned the whole table. It now applies a bounded default (1000) and honors an explicit `SearchOptions.limit`.

### Changed
- SQLite FTS ranking now uses `bm25()` column weighting (title >> description > tags), mirroring the Postgres `ts_rank_cd` A/B/C weights so both backends rank equivalently. The FTS path is unioned with the id/short_id/working_dir/metadata LIKE fallback so identifier/fingerprint/path pastes still resolve, with full-text hits ranked first.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Postgres full-text search parity (cloud/self-hosted returned nothing). `searchTasks` only ever queried the local SQLite FTS5 index, which is empty on a Postgres deployment. Task search now runs through the storage abstraction (`store.tasks.list({ query })`) so cloud/self-hosted executes a real Postgres query.

### Added
- `migrations/0006_task_fulltext_search.sql`: a weighted (`title`>`description`>`tags`) `tsvector` generated column on `todos_sync_records`, a GIN index for ranked full-text search, and a `pg_trgm` trigram GIN index for typo/fuzzy matching, all diacritics-insensitive via an immutable `unaccent` wrapper. Idempotent with automatic backfill; mirrored into `postgresTodosSyncSchemaSql` so fresh cloud bootstraps get it too.
- `TaskFilter.query` full-text field, honored by BOTH storage adapters so `GET /v1/tasks?q=` searches whether the server is Postgres- or SQLite-backed. The Postgres adapter emits a `websearch_to_tsquery` predicate (AND-by-default, quoted phrases, punctuation-tolerant) with a single-term `pg_trgm` word-similarity fuzzy fallback, ranked by `ts_rank_cd`; the local SQLite adapter routes the query through the FTS5 `searchTasks` path and applies the remaining filters. Exposed over `GET /v1/tasks?q=`; the `todos search` CLI routes through it under a self-hosted authority.

## [0.11.96] - 2026-07-24

### Security
- Remove internal production-infrastructure identifiers from the published open-source package. The managed database cluster name and the AWS Secrets Manager runtime path are no longer hardcoded in `src/storage/config.ts`; they are now supplied at runtime by the private hosting wrapper via `HASNA_TODOS_RDS_CLUSTER` and `HASNA_TODOS_RDS_RUNTIME_PATH`, and resolve to `null` when unset (no baked-in defaults).
- Scrub the internal cloud domain (`*.hasna.xyz`) from source comments, the `union-backfill` script default endpoint, and test fixtures; compose the private billing host in the headless outbound-boundary allowlist from parts so it is not shipped as a plaintext literal (the outbound guard still blocks it).
- Replace the real fleet machine identifier and private Tailscale/LAN addresses in the README machine-topology example with neutral placeholders.

### Changed
- **Breaking (public API):** `getCanonicalTodosRdsConfig()` now accepts an optional `env` argument and returns `cluster` / `runtimeSecretPath` as `string | null`. The exported constants `CANONICAL_TODOS_RDS_CLUSTER` and `CANONICAL_TODOS_RDS_RUNTIME_PATH` are replaced by `CANONICAL_TODOS_RDS_CLUSTER_ENV` and `CANONICAL_TODOS_RDS_RUNTIME_PATH_ENV`.

## [0.11.92] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Route supported ordinary CLI coordination commands through the configured authenticated self-hosted `/v1` authority when remote storage mode is selected, before any local database adapter or ID helper can run.
- Fail closed on missing credentials, invalid or conflicting storage selectors, unsafe or incompatible authority URLs/routes, redirects, authentication errors, timeouts, and server failures; remote commands never fall back to SQLite.
- Make remote storage/status diagnostics HTTP-aware and harden release verification so a candidate must come from a clean tracked tree with commit/tree provenance and verified tarball integrity.
- Gate evidence-bearing remote completion on the authority's advertised OpenAPI contract, resolve short task references only from a stats-stable exhaustive snapshot, and preserve existing completion evidence atomically.
- Split public release verification into non-authoritative review and strict prepublish modes, pin Bun 1.3.14, verify tracked bytes/modes and packed binary provenance, and require two identical npm tarballs and payload manifests.

## [0.11.76] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- Auto project detection now skips disposable git roots under the system temp directory, preventing accidental registration of transient `/tmp` project shells.
- Added guarded `todos projects --deregister` support that preserves tasks and refuses to deregister any project with incomplete tasks.

## [0.11.75] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- `todos doctor routing` — deterministic routing-metadata drift detection (wrong/null `working_dir`, null/unresolvable `task_list_id`, invalid project paths, cross-repo intent, no-auto conflicts) with per-finding `repair_class` (`safe_auto` | `blocker_*` | `unsupported`), project-stable `--shard i/N` scoping, and a machine-consumable `--json` contract (`todos.routing_doctor.v1`) with documented exit codes (0 clean / 1 findings / 2 invalid invocation).
- `todos doctor routing --apply` — safe repairs for `safe_auto` findings only, via supported update paths (no raw DB edits), with a DB backup, per-task evidence comments, and an undo record carrying real per-repair undo commands.
- `todos update --working-dir <path>`, `--clear-working-dir`, and `--clear-list` — first-class routing-metadata repair and null-reset flags for existing tasks; `--list` now resolves exact UUID → partial UUID → project-scoped slug (UUID authoritative) and errors on unresolvable references instead of silently succeeding.
- `scripts/routing-health-scan.mjs` — deterministic OpenLoops command-loop consumer of the doctor JSON (deduped per-scope task upserts), and `scripts/routing-remediation.workflow.json` — validated planner → worker → adversarial-reviewer remediation workflow spec.

### Fixed
- `doctor routing --apply`/`--fix` reached the subcommand as a silent dry-run (Commander actionable-parent option shadowing); the flags now apply and are guarded by a CLI-level end-to-end regression test.
- Multi-megabyte `doctor routing --json` reports intermittently truncated when stdout was a pipe; now emitted through the flush-safe writer.

## [0.11.74] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- Task `route_state` made authoritative and aligned with the OpenLoops drain: the `auto:route`/`route:enabled` tag authorizes routing when `route_enabled` is unset; explicit denies and `no-auto` still deny. Added `route_class`, route evidence, and optional project-root verification (backfilled entry for the #37/#38 release).

## [0.11.73] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **Security:** authenticate the `/mcp` endpoint and rate-limit it (and `/health`) — previously an unauthenticated write surface even with `--api-key` set. Preserves the 127.0.0.1-no-key default.
- **Security:** key the HTTP rate limiter on `server.requestIP`; honor `X-Forwarded-For` only under `TODOS_TRUST_PROXY` (was spoofable / shared "unknown" bucket).
- Task completion lifecycle: `completeTask` returns the correct post-commit version (was stale → follow-up updates conflicted) and is idempotent; completion via `updateTask`/PATCH/CLI now spawns recurrence exactly once and clears the lock; reopening clears `completed_at`; confidence preserved when omitted.
- `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` accepts a client version and maps conflicts→409 / not-found→404 (was last-write-wins / 500).
- `todos mcp` now starts a stdio server and bare `todos-mcp` defaults to stdio (register writers pass `--stdio`) — clients were booting HTTP and never speaking stdio.
- `--json` now works on `next`/`claim`/`status`/`fail`/`active`/`stale`/`redistribute` including empty results; added `log-progress` alias; typed not-found errors; CLI input validation.
- Removed phantom MCP tools from the registry, CLI/MCP parity manifest, and golden fixture; exposed `upsert_task` and metadata tools in profiles.
- `ensureSchema` backfills migration-48 columns; WAL-safe `restoreDatabase`; stable cursor ordering; `countTasks` mirrors `listTasks` filters; SDK no longer drops 4-byte bodies and authenticates `subscribe()`.
